**Project Name:** SmallDapp

**Description:** SmallDapp is a decentralized application (DApp) project that focuses on building a small-scale decentralized application. The project covers fundamental aspects of blockchain technology, including connecting to a local blockchain, writing data to the blockchain, reading data from the blockchain, and implementing data storage on a server with frontend integration.

**Key Objectives:**
1. **Connect with Local Blockchain**: The project includes the establishment of connections to a local blockchain network. This involves configuring the DApp to interact with the blockchain infrastructure.

2. **Write on Blockchain**: SmallDapp allows users to create and submit transactions to the blockchain. This functionality is essential for recording data on the blockchain in a secure and immutable manner.

3. **Read from Blockchain**: The DApp provides the capability to query and retrieve data from the blockchain. Users can access stored information, promoting transparency and data accessibility.

4. **Data Storage on Server**: SmallDapp incorporates a server-side component for data storage. This ensures that data can be efficiently managed and retrieved outside the blockchain when necessary.

5. **Frontend Integration**: The project integrates a user-friendly frontend to interact with the DApp. Users can access and interact with the decentralized application through a well-designed user interface.
